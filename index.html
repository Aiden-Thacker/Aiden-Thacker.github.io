										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hello, I am Aiden Thacker, and I am currently in my last semester as a Junior. I have been working in Unity for three years and Unreal for about a year and a half. I have learned a lot; however, I still have much to learn. I would love to get into level design if given the opportunity.</p>

											<p>I am working as a programmer with a small group of alumni on a 3d Unreal Engine game. Where the cats have gone crazy and you, the player, must capture them before they wreak havoc. We now have a Steam Page up.</p>

											<p>A Octebor based game jam resulting in "Strange Compainion" as the theme. I worked in a team that was insipred by the ogrinial Doom video game, so play Frankenstein's monster on a quest to take revenge on your creator.  Defeat the other monsters to get closer to your creator.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Crown of Screws</h3>
											<p>This was a game jam project. The theme was "Unwanted Abilities," so we created a game where you crash land on a strange planet of machines and must do your best to survive waves of enemies as they surge forth. This was the first game jam where I contributed to the art, specifically the UI art, and I also coded the UI. I also assisted my teammates with their code and contributed to the overall game design.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Wakefield</h3>
											<p>Over the summer, I participated in a game jam where my team created a 3D, 8-bit-inspired roguelike with procedural dungeons. I coded the entire player and their weapons, the store room where you buy weapons and upgrades, and I integrated the sound into the game.</p>

											<p>Analog Brawl was created fall semester of 2023 with Unity. I was able to become the lead programmer and develop a lot of the mechanics used in the game. Analog Brawl is a 2D-pixel art fighting game where you play as old technology no one uses anymore.</p>
