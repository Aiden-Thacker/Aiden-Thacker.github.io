										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>Hello, I am Aiden Thacker, and I am currently in my last semester as a Junior. I have been working in Unity for three years and Unreal for about a year and a half. I have learned a lot; however, I still have much to learn. I would love to get into level design if given the opportunity.</p>
